          Publisher, as identified below, owns or controls the below listed
          website(s) within Embi Media’s publisher network and desires to
          receive the Taboola Service on an exclusive basis during the Term.
        </li>
        <li>
          Publisher agrees that Taboola will be Publisher’s exclusive content
          recommendation provider during the Term, and it will not engage any
          third party, including without limitation, any of Taboola’s
          competitors (e.g., AdBlade, BroadSpring, Content.Ad, Crowdignite,
          Dianomi, Facebook Audience Network, Google Content Recommendations,
          Gravity, Inform, Media.net, Nativo, Outbrain, Polar, RevContent,
          Sharethrough, Teads, Tout, Virool, Vuble, Yahoo! Content
          Recommendations, YieldMo, ZergNet, and Zinc by Zedo) to make content
          (recommendations or to play video content, or to provide a
          revenuegenerating content recommendation service that is similar to
          the Taboola Service provided by Taboola on the Websites. Publisher
          further agrees that it will not use any services provided by Outbrain
          (except Publisher shall be permitted to buy traffic from Outbrain),
          directly or indirectly, at any time during the Term. For clarity,
          Publisher agrees that any revenue-generating content recommendation
          services or video player provided by a third party prior to the IO
          Effective Date will be replaced by Taboola’s Service on or before the
          IO Effective Date in any territories where Taboola offers its
          services. It is understood and agreed that the Publisher shall be
          deemed to be in breach of the foregoing exclusivity clause should it
          keep the Service on the Websites but divert all of its traffic to a
          new website. Accordingly, Publisher agrees that, in addition to any
          other rights or remedies Embi may have, this Insertion Order may be
          terminated due to an uncured breach by Publisher of the exclusivity
          restriction herein.
        </li>
        <li>
          . The term of this Insertion Order (will commence upon the IO
          Effective Date and will, unless terminated as set forth herein,
          continue for a period of thirty (30) days from the implementation of
          the Widget on all of the article pages of the Websites (the “Trial
          Period”). At the end of the Trial Period, the term of this Insertion
          Order will automatically extend for an additional twelve (12) month
          period (the “Initial Term”), unless terminated as set forth herein. At
          the end of the Initial Term, the term of this Insertion Order will
          automatically renew for additional, successive twelve (12) month
          periods (each, a “Renewal Term” and the Initial Term and all Renewal
          Terms, collectively the “Term”), unless one party notifies the other
          in writing of its intention not to renew at least thirty (30) days
          prior to the end of the then-current Term. Publisher or Embi Media may
          terminate this Insertion immediately in the event that the other party
          fails to cure a material breach of this Insertion Order that is
          capable of being cured within five (5) days of its receipt of written
          notice thereof (email shall be sufficient). Embi Media may terminate
          this Insertion Order immediately on 24 hours written notice (email
          shall be sufficient) if Embi Media’s agreement with Taboola is
          terminated and it no longer has the right to use the Taboola Services
          on the Websites.
